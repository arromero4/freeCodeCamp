        Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. While HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.

As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
</p>
<p>
  A <strong>document</strong> is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Presenting</strong> a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.

      CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."

The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:
    </p>
    <code>
      h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
      }
    </code>
    <p>
      The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings <code>h1</code>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.
    </p>
    <code>
      h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

p {
    color: black;
}
    </code>

      As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and other features it contains.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar things and are therefore probably in the same specification.

The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
    </p>
<p>
  To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the <code>head</code> of the HTML document:
    </p>
    <code>link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"</code>
    
    
    <p>Getting started with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Starting with some HTML</li>
      <li>Adding CSS to our document</li>
      <li>Styling HTML elements</li>
      <li>Changing the default behavior of elements</li>
      <li>Adding a class</li>
      <li>Styling things based on their location in a document</li>
      <li>Styling things based on state</li>
      <li>Combining selectors and combinators</li>
    </ul>

By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs green you would use:
    </p>
    <code>p {
  color: green;
}</code>
